# ZX Panel â€” Help & User Guide

**ZX Panel** is a real-time image processing plugin for Adobe Photoshop that transforms your document into a native **ZX Spectrum screen format**, non-destructively and instantly.

## ðŸ§½ General Info

ZX Panel is designed for artists creating ZX Spectrum graphics. It automates all attribute-related limitations (clash rules, color limits, bright/flash attributes, etc.), while retaining the full power of Photoshop's layer-based workflow.

Compatible with:

* 8-bit or 16-bit RGB documents
* Sizes from **8Ã—8 px up to 512Ã—384 px**, in **8-pixel steps** (width and height must be divisible by 8)

If the current document does not meet these criteria, the preview will show a message indicating unsupported format.

## ðŸ–¼ Preview Panel

The large central preview displays the real-time ZX-converted version of the currently active document.

To ensure **sharp, crisp pixels** without moirÃ© artifacts, press <img src="docs/images/prefs.png" alt="Sys Scale" width="24"> **Sys Scale Adjustment** and select the correct system scale (matches your OS settings).

Below are <img src="docs/images/zoomout.png" alt="Zoom Out" width="24"> and <img src="docs/images/zoomin.png" alt="Zoom In" width="24"> buttons, controlling preview scale (1x to 4x).

## ðŸ—Œ Paste Button

<img src="docs/images/paste.png" alt="Paste" width="24"> **Paste** inserts a rendered copy of the preview into a new layer (useful to fix parts of your artwork into ZX format mid-process).

## ðŸŽ› Dithering Panel

* **Dropdown Menu**: Choose a dithering algorithm that best suits your artwork.
* <img src="docs/images/flip.png" alt="Flip" width="24"> **Flip Button**: Available for algorithms that support horizontal mirroring.
* **Strength Slider**: Controls dithering intensity (0%â€“100%). With threshold selected, it acts as brightness cutoff level.

## ðŸŒˆ Attribute Controls

<img src="docs/images/bright.png" alt="Bright" width="24"> **Bright Button**:

* Toggles bright mode: off / on / auto-detect per attribute block.

<img src="docs/images/flash.png" alt="Flash" width="24"> **Flash Button**:

* Activates flash layer mode.
* ZX Panel will look for a layer named `FLASH` (or create one if missing).
* Any pixels painted in this layer (at least one per 8Ã—8 block) will mark the block as flashing.
* If only one color is present in a block, the second flash color will be automatically picked from painted pixels in the FLASH layer.
* You can **hide** or move this layer back to avoid affecting the image pixels.

## ðŸ“¥ Import / ðŸ“¤ Export

<img src="docs/images/import.png" alt="Import" width="24"> **Import**:

* Load a standard `.scr` (6912 bytes) screen file â€” output will be placed in a new layer.

<img src="docs/images/export.png" alt="Export" width="24"> **Export**:

* Save the current document as a `.scr` file.
* If smaller than 256Ã—192 px, it will be padded with black.
* If larger, it will be **split** into 2 or 4 `.scr` files accordingly.

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

* Work in **16-bit mode** for cleaner gradients.
* Disable Photoshop's own **dithering** for brushes and gradients to avoid unwanted noise.
